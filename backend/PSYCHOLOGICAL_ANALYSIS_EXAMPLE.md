# ðŸ§  Psychological Analysis System - Example

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

The psychological analysis system analyzes user's comic prompts across all three worlds to generate AI-powered psychological insights. Here's how it works:

### **1. Data Collection**
The system collects comic data from all three worlds:

```python
# Get comics from each world
imagination_comics = [
    {
        "concept": "a girl with dark long hair was sitting around the window",
        "genre": "drama",
        "world_type": "imagination_world"
    },
    {
        "concept": "a magical forest with glowing butterflies",
        "genre": "fantasy", 
        "world_type": "imagination_world"
    }
]

mind_comics = [
    {
        "concept": "a detective ponders over a mysterious case",
        "genre": "mystery",
        "world_type": "mind_world"
    },
    {
        "concept": "a scientist contemplates the nature of reality",
        "genre": "sci-fi",
        "world_type": "mind_world"
    }
]

dream_comics = [
    {
        "concept": "a surreal dream with floating objects",
        "genre": "fantasy",
        "world_type": "dream_world"
    },
    {
        "concept": "a shadowy figure in a misty landscape",
        "genre": "horror",
        "world_type": "dream_world"
    }
]
```

### **2. AI Analysis Prompt**
The system sends this data to Azure OpenAI with a structured prompt:

```
Analyze the user's comic creation patterns across three psychological worlds. For each world, identify:

1. **Dominant emotional tone** - What emotional atmosphere prevails?
2. **Most common genre(s)** - What story types does the user prefer?
3. **Recurring symbols or story elements** - What motifs appear repeatedly?
4. **Typical character role** - What character archetypes dominate (hero, observer, victim, wanderer, etc.)?

Then synthesize a single, psychologically informed assumption about the user based on cross-world patterns.

**Imagination World Data:**
Concepts: ["a girl with dark long hair was sitting around the window", "a magical forest with glowing butterflies"]
Genres: ["drama", "fantasy"]
Count: 2

**Mind World Data:**
Concepts: ["a detective ponders over a mysterious case", "a scientist contemplates the nature of reality"]
Genres: ["mystery", "sci-fi"]
Count: 2

**Dream World Data:**
Concepts: ["a surreal dream with floating objects", "a shadowy figure in a misty landscape"]
Genres: ["fantasy", "horror"]
Count: 2
```

### **3. AI Response**
The AI generates a structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "world_profiles": {
    "imagination_world": {
      "dominant_emotional_tone": "contemplative and magical",
      "most_common_genres": ["drama", "fantasy"],
      "recurring_symbols": ["windows", "nature", "magical elements", "solitary figures"],
      "typical_character_role": "observer/contemplator",
      "psychological_theme": "introspective exploration of inner worlds"
    },
    "mind_world": {
      "dominant_emotional_tone": "analytical and curious",
      "most_common_genres": ["mystery", "sci-fi"],
      "recurring_symbols": ["puzzles", "scientific concepts", "intellectual challenges"],
      "typical_character_role": "investigator/thinker",
      "psychological_theme": "intellectual problem-solving and philosophical inquiry"
    },
    "dream_world": {
      "dominant_emotional_tone": "mysterious and unsettling",
      "most_common_genres": ["fantasy", "horror"],
      "recurring_symbols": ["shadows", "floating objects", "mist", "surreal elements"],
      "typical_character_role": "wanderer/explorer",
      "psychological_theme": "exploration of subconscious and unknown territories"
    }
  },
  "cross_world_patterns": {
    "emotional_consistency": "User consistently explores introspective and contemplative themes across all worlds",
    "genre_evolution": "Progression from magical realism (imagination) to intellectual inquiry (mind) to surreal exploration (dream)",
    "character_development": "Evolution from observer to investigator to explorer, showing increasing agency",
    "symbolic_connections": "Recurring themes of exploration, mystery, and the unknown across all worlds"
  },
  "psychological_assumption": "This user is a contemplative individual who uses creative expression as a means of intellectual and emotional exploration. They show a preference for introspective themes and demonstrate a natural progression from passive observation to active investigation to deep exploration of the unknown. Their creative patterns suggest someone who values both analytical thinking and intuitive understanding.",
  "confidence_level": 0.85,
  "recommendation_areas": [
    "Encourage exploration of more complex character interactions",
    "Suggest experimenting with different narrative perspectives",
    "Recommend exploring collaborative storytelling themes"
  ]
}
```
