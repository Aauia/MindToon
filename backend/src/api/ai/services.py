# 🎨 Art Style System
CONSISTENT_STYLES = {
    "cartoon": "Vibrant, expressive cartoon illustration. Features bold, clean outlines, simplified forms, and bright, flat colors with minimal shading. Characters have exaggerated features and dynamic poses. The style should evoke a modern animated series or a stylized graphic novel, distinct from classic Disney or traditional cel animation. Focus on clear visual storytelling and energetic composition.",

    "comic book": "Classic American comic book art style. Characterized by strong, impactful linework, dynamic action poses, and a vibrant, high-contrast color palette often with distinct black inks. Panels are designed for dramatic effect, with clear visual hierarchy and a focus on impactful storytelling typical of superhero or adventure comics. Features clear muscle definition, detailed expressions, and a bold, iconic aesthetic.",

    "manga": "Authentic Japanese manga illustration style. Defined by precise, sharp linework, a predominant use of black and white tones with occasional selective spot colors (often muted). Characters feature large, expressive eyes, nuanced facial expressions, and dynamic motion effects. Backgrounds can range from highly detailed to abstract, utilizing screentones for shading and texture. Emphasizes character emotion and narrative flow.",

    "anime": "Modern Japanese anime visual style. Characterized by vibrant, often saturated colors, detailed character designs with large expressive eyes, and dynamic compositions. Shading is typically cel-shaded (flat blocks of color for shadows and highlights). The aesthetic is clean, polished, and suitable for action or emotional drama, resembling high-quality animated series or feature films.",

    "realistic": "Photorealistic digital painting style. Focuses on highly detailed rendering, accurate anatomy, naturalistic lighting with subtle shadows and highlights, and lifelike textures. Proportions are realistic, and the overall impression is one of cinematic realism or a finely detailed classical painting, executed digitally. High fidelity to real-world appearance.",

    "watercolor": "Evocative watercolor painting style. Features soft, translucent washes of color with visible brushstrokes and a delicate, often ethereal quality. Outlines are minimal or entirely absent, allowing colors to blend naturally. The paper texture may be subtle. The mood is often calm, artistic, and flowing, reminiscent of traditional art mediums.",

    "sketch": "Expressive pencil sketch or charcoal drawing style. Characterized by visible, energetic hand-drawn lines, cross-hatching or subtle smudged shading for depth. The artwork feels raw and immediate, showcasing the artist's hand. Typically black and white or sepia-toned, with a focus on form and texture over detailed color.",

    "pixel art": "Distinctive pixel art style. Employs a low-resolution aesthetic with clearly visible square pixels, reminiscent of classic 8-bit or 16-bit video game graphics. Features blocky, stylized sprites, a limited color palette, and often strong, simple outlines. Can include isometric or side-scrolling perspectives. The charm lies in its retro, digital blocky aesthetic.",

    "minimalist": "Clean and sleek minimalist art style. Characterized by simple, geometric shapes, a very limited and often muted color palette, and abundant use of negative space. Focuses on conveying essence with few elements, resulting in a modern, abstract, and often serene aesthetic. Emphasizes clarity, functionality, and simplicity over detail.",

    "vintage": "Nostalgic vintage illustration style. Evokes a retro aesthetic, often inspired by mid-20th century advertising or children's book illustrations. Features muted or sepia-toned color palettes, subtle grain or aged paper textures, and stylized figures. The linework can vary but generally aims for a charming, classic, and slightly distressed look.",

    "noir": "Gritty, high-contrast film noir style. Dominated by deep shadows, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, and a predominantly monochrome (black, white, grays) or desaturated color palette with occasional splashes of bold color. Focuses on mystery, tension, and dramatic silhouettes, reflecting classic detective comics or films.",

    "storybook": "Whimsical and warm storybook illustration style. Features soft, inviting colors, gentle outlines (or painterly edges), and a focus on charming character designs. The style often has a slightly textured or painterly feel, suitable for children's literature, evoking a cozy and imaginative atmosphere.",

    "pop art": "Bold and graphic Pop Art style. Inspired by comic books and advertising, it uses strong outlines, bright, often unmixed colors, and sometimes incorporates halftone dot patterns or speech bubbles. Focuses on iconic imagery and everyday objects, with a flat, graphic, and energetic feel."

    CONCEPT: {prompt}

    ART STYLE: {art_style or 'determine from the genre'}

    CHARACTER DESIGN GUIDE (ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR CONSISTENCY):
    - Based on the 'CONCEPT', identify the main characters. For EACH main character, provide a detailed, single-line visual description that is precise and visually distinct.
    - Example Format: "For [Character Name]: [Detailed visual description of character's appearance, ensuring consistency for Stable Diffusion prompts, e.g., 'Elon Musk, 40s, slightly messy brown hair, wearing a casual grey crewneck t-shirt and dark jeans, friendly expression']. This description MUST be used every time the character appears."

    IMPORTANT: These character designs MUST remain 100% consistent across all 6 panels in their visual representation (e.g., size, shape, color, costume details, unique features). DO NOT describe character changes unless it's an explicit transformation within the narrative.

    🎨 GENRE-SPECIFIC CREATIVE GUIDANCE:
    - MOOD: {genre_guide['mood']} - Every dialogue and action must reflect this emotional tone.
    - ATMOSPHERE: {genre_guide['atmosphere']} - The entire story world should feel {genre_guide['atmosphere']}.
    - VISUAL STYLE: {art_style_guide}
    - COLOR PALETTE: {genre_guide['palette']} - This influences the visual description of every scene.
    - LIGHTING: {genre_guide['lighting']} - Describe lighting that creates {genre_guide['mood']} mood.
    - VISUAL ELEMENTS: {genre_guide['visual_cues']} - Include these environmental and atmospheric details to enrich the scene.

    The story MUST be written in the {genre_lower} genre with {genre_guide['mood']} tone throughout.

    MANDATORY 6-PANEL STRUCTURE:

    INTRODUCTION (Panels 1-2):
    Panel 1: SETUP & CHARACTER INTRODUCTION
    - Introduce main characters and setting in a normal, peaceful environment (e.g., a cozy kitchen, a vibrant city park shall be suitable according to the {genre_guide['mood']}).
    - Show characters in their typical daily routine or relaxed state.
    - Ensure the {genre_lower} mood and tone.
    - Dialogue: Exactly two lines. One for character introduction/greeting, one line establishing the world or their routine. Keep tone light and conversational.
    - VISUAL FRAMING: **Wide shot** or **establish shot** to introduce the full setting and all main characters clearly. Focus on clear view of characters in their environment.
    - NARRATIVE PURPOSE: Establish the status quo and character dynamics BEFORE any conflict. Do NOT introduce the inciting incident here.
    - VISUAL DETAILS: Explicitly reference and describe all main characters using their established design. Describe the scene's color palette, lighting, and visual elements.

    Panel 2: INCITING INCIDENT
    - Something unexpected happens that changes everything. This should be the 'cinnamon on the crust' incident (a significant, surprising disruption).
    - Show the moment that disrupts the normal world. Characters react with surprise, confusion, or concern.
    - Dialogue: Exactly two lines. One line expressing surprise/reaction to the incident, one line questioning or acknowledging the disruption. Dialogue should show personality and relationship dynamics.
    - VISUAL FRAMING: **Medium shot** or **close-up** on the inciting incident itself (e.g., an object being defiled, a sudden appearance), showing characters' immediate reactions clearly. Focus on the object or event causing the disruption AND the characters' expressions.
    - NARRATIVE PURPOSE: Introduce the core conflict. This panel MUST pivot the story. Do NOT resolve anything here.
    - VISUAL DETAILS: Highlight the source of the problem. Ensure characters show appropriate surprise/disgust. Maintain consistency with the Panel 1 setting if the incident occurs there (e.g., "In the cozy kitchen, the oven explodes..."). Explicitly reference and describe all main characters using their established design. Describe the scene's color palette, lighting, and visual elements.

    MAIN ACTION (Panels 3-5):
    Panel 3: RISING ACTION - FIRST CHALLENGE
    - Characters actively engage with the conflict/problem. Show them taking action or making important decisions.
    - Build tension through character choices and obstacles.
    - Dialogue: Exactly two lines. One line showing character determination or strategy, one line directly addressing the challenge. Show character personality through how they handle pressure.
    - VISUAL FRAMING: **Action shot** or **medium shot**. Clearly depict the characters interacting with the challenge (e.g., confronting an antagonist, strategizing, beginning a journey). Show their full bodies if engaged in physical action, but keep their faces visible.
    - NARRATIVE PURPOSE: Show the characters attempting to overcome the conflict, encountering initial obstacles. Tension should build.
    - VISUAL DETAILS: Characters should be in dynamic poses, reflecting their action or decision. Maintain consistent character designs. Describe the scene's color palette, lighting, and visual elements.

    Panel 4: CLIMAX - PEAK CONFLICT
    - The most intense, dramatic moment of the entire story. Highest emotional stakes and maximum tension.
    - Genre-specific peak action (e.g., a major confrontation, a powerful attack, a crucial discovery).
    - Dialogue: Exactly two lines. One line expressing intense emotions or a crucial decision, one line related to the core conflict's peak. Characters reveal their true nature under pressure.
    - VISUAL FRAMING: **Close-up on the characters' faces** to capture intense emotions, or a **dynamic wide/medium shot** highlighting the peak action. The focal point MUST be the most dramatic element. Show the impact of the climax.
    - NARRATIVE PURPOSE: This is the single most intense moment. All previous tension culminates here. Do NOT begin the resolution in this panel.
    - VISUAL DETAILS: Exaggerate expressions if appropriate for genre. Show environmental damage or dramatic effects caused by the climax. Explicitly reference and describe all main characters using their established design. Describe the scene's color palette, lighting, and visual elements.

    Panel 5: FALLING ACTION - CONSEQUENCES
    - Immediate results and aftermath of the climax. Characters process what just happened. Begin to understand the implications.
    - Dialogue: Exactly two lines. One line reflecting on events, one line showing emotional processing or the immediate consequence. Show character growth or change from the experience.
    - VISUAL FRAMING: **Medium shot** to show characters reacting to the aftermath. Can include elements of the destroyed or changed environment from the climax. Focus on their emotional state and the immediate results of the climax.
    - NARRATIVE PURPOSE: Show the immediate fallout of the climax. Characters begin to understand the new reality. Do NOT fully resolve the story here.
    - VISUAL DETAILS: Characters might appear weary, bruised, or showing relief/shock. The environment should reflect the recent conflict. Explicitly reference and describe all main characters using their established design. Describe the scene's color palette, lighting, and visual elements.

    CONCLUSION (Panel 6):
    Panel 6: RESOLUTION & ENDING
    - Story conclusion with a clear, satisfying outcome. Show how characters have been changed by the experience.
    - Genre-appropriate ending (e.g., comedic resolution with a final joke, emotional resolution, adventure victory).
    - Dialogue: Exactly two lines. One line for final reflection, one memorable closing line that ties back to the opening or theme. Leave the reader satisfied with the character journey.
    - VISUAL FRAMING: **Wide shot** or **medium shot** showing the characters in their new, resolved state or environment. A sense of peace or finality should be conveyed.
    - NARRATIVE PURPOSE: Provide a clear, satisfying conclusion to the main plot and character arcs. This is the final state of the story.
    - VISUAL DETAILS: Characters should appear content or changed, and the environment should reflect the resolution. Explicitly reference and describe all main characters using their established design. Describe the scene's color palette, lighting, and visual elements.

    CRITICAL DIALOGUE & CHARACTER REQUIREMENTS:
    - Each character must have a CONSISTENT voice, personality, and speaking style throughout all 6 panels.
    - Character names must be consistent across all panels.
    - Dialogue must reflect each character's unique personality traits.
    - The "{genre_lower}" genre MUST profoundly influence: dialogue tone, character reactions, emotional depth, and narrative progression.
    - The art style "{art_style_lower}" MUST be identical across ALL panels. This includes a consistent color palette, lighting, line work, shading, and the EXACT character designs specified in the 'CHARACTER DESIGN GUIDE' above. NO DEVIATION IN ART STYLE OR CHARACTER APPEARANCE IS PERMITTED.
    - Panel progression must show clear character development from introduction to conclusion.

    STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL):
    - Your response MUST contain EXACTLY 6 frames in the frames array. Any deviation will result in failure.
    - Each panel MUST have exactly 2 dialogue lines that are concise and directly advance the narrative. Do NOT add more or less dialogue.
    - Dialogue should flow naturally between panels, clearly showing the evolution of character relationships and the plot.
    - Characters must react authentically to events based on their established personalities and motivations.
    - ENSURE that the narrative pacing perfectly matches the 6-panel breakdown: Panels 1-2 for Introduction, Panels 3-5 for Main Action, and Panel 6 for Conclusion.

    ABSOLUTE MANDATES FOR SCENARIO GENERATION:
    - ENSURE that the visual descriptions for each panel explicitly reference the established character designs to reinforce consistency.
    - EVERY panel description must include details about the specific 'VISUAL STYLE', 'COLOR PALETTE', and 'LIGHTING' from the creative guidance to ensure stylistic uniformity.
    - Avoid introducing new characters or significant changes to the environment unless explicitly part of the 6-panel structure.
    - The panel descriptions should be rich enough to directly inform an image generation model, focusing on clear visual elements, character poses, and expressions.
    - AVOID: Narrator boxes, internal thoughts (unless conveyed via facial expression/body language), or lengthy prose that doesn't translate directly into a comic panel's visual or dialogue. Focus on "show, don't tell" for the comic scenario.
